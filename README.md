# Mobility
Based on a program I developed for PH 352 in 2019-2020, the Mobility app aims to mitigate the effects of Food Deserts. The user can scan a barcode at the store and will learn nutritional facts and recipies based on that ingredient. The target population in mind in the original program was seasonal farmworkers but can be adapted to any population.
